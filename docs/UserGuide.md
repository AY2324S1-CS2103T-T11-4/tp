## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add w/WORD t/TRANSLATION`, `WORD` and `TRANSLATION` are a parameter which can be used as `add w/regarder t/look`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Output:
* `Success`: File has been successfully loaded from <FILEPATH>
* `Failure`: File has not been loaded from <FILEPATH>. Please confirm that the path is correct, and that it is a file generated by FlashLingo.


### Saving the data

Flashlingo data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
