### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashlingo/Main.java) and [`MainApp.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashlingo/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Flashcard` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashlingo/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### UI enhancement (Nathanael M. Tan)

#### Implementation

Display of flashcard details is split into two different classes of `FlashcardBox` and `FlashcardBoxNoButtons`
FlashcardBoxNoButtons is the default way to display the details of the flashcard.\
When `start` command is used, review session begins and FlashcardBox is then used to display the details.\
This is to prevent users from reviewing cards that they are not scheduled to review and erroneously cause changes to the flashcard.

Both `FlashcardBox` and `FlashcardBoxNoButtons` have a button at the right called that is called "Reveal" when the translation is not shown, and "Hide" when it is.\
This button will toggle the state of whether the translation is currently displayed.

`FlashcardBox` has an additional two buttons, the `Yes` button and the `No` button.\
The `Yes` button will invoke the yes command, just like if it were to be typed into the command line
Similarly, the `No` button will invoke the no command.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to invoke the command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pass MainWindow all the way into FlashcardBox. Use `executeCommand()` method to invoke the respective command
    * Pros: 
      * High level of maintainability. 
      * Outcome will be the same as if it were to be typed into the CLI.
      * Easy to change logic of the commands
    * Cons: 
      * Have to pass MainWindow through multiple classes
      * Classes that do not need references to MainWindow are now forced to have them

* **Alternative 2:** Individual button can perform the `Yes` and `No` command by itself, without executing through a Command
    * Pros: 
      * Don't have to keep reference to the MainWindow
    * Cons: 
      * Low level of maintainability. 
      * Changes made have to be replicated in different places.
      * May not behave the same way as a Command (eg. ResultDisplay does not show the log message)

* **Alternative 2:** Remove the `Yes` and `No` buttons.
    * Pros:
        * Easy to code
        * Only one way to invoke the command, reduce confusion
    * Cons:
        * Less convenient without the buttons, needing to type

### Start and End Session

#### **Feature Overview**

The "Start and End Review Session" feature is designed for users to start or end a review session. It allows users to initiate and conclude dedicated language learning sessions where they focus on reviewing and practicing vocabulary words. Each session represents a focused period of language reviewing within the application.

#### **Implementation**

The implementation of the "Start and End Review Session" feature involves the introduction of a `SessionManager` component. The `SessionManager` tracks the following aspect of a review session:

- **isReviewSession:** Indicates whether the application in a review session or not.

In addition to that, `start` and `end` commands and their corresponding parsers are also implemented.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the start/end mechanism behaves at each step.  

**Step 1:** The user launches the application for the first time. The `SessionManager` is not yet initialized.

**Step 2:** The user executes the "start" command by interacting with the command line. This will make `FlashlingoParser` class to create its `SessionManager` instance.

![SessionManagerClass](images/SessionManagerClass.png)  
**Note**: The `SessionManager` class adheres to the **Singleton pattern**, guaranteeing that only one instance of the class 
can exist. This architectural choice provides a single point of access for managing review sessions and 
maintaining the state of whether the session is a review session or not. With the Singleton pattern in place, you can be
confident that there is only one `SessionManager` instance, making it a centralized and controlled entity for session 
management within the application.

**Step 3:** The user executes various commands within the action sequence, such as `yes` and `no`.

**Step 4:** The user chooses to end the review session by using `end` command. This action will alternate the boolean value 
inside SessionManager class indicating current session is review session or not.

![StartSequnceModel](images/StartSequenceDiagram.png)  
**Recording Vocabulary Review:**
- The `SessionManager` logs the vocabulary words and phrases reviewed and practiced during the language learning session.
- This feature provides users with the ability to track their progress and revisit the words they've worked on.

**User Control:**
- Users can initiate a new language learning session at any time and conclude their session when they have completed their vocabulary review.
- The option to start and end language learning sessions is typically available in the language learning module or settings.

**Data Retention:**
- Session data, including start and end times and vocabulary review records, is stored locally on the user's device.
- Users may have the option to export or clear session data as needed.

**Session Summary:**
- Users can view a summary of their language learning session, including the start and end times and a list of vocabulary words and phrases reviewed.

**Privacy and Security:**
- The application should ensure the privacy and security of session data, particularly if it contains sensitive language learning content.

#### **Usage Example**

1. **Starting a Language Learning Session:** The user accesses the language learning module within the application and chooses to start a new language learning session.

2. **Vocabulary Review:** During the session, the user focuses on reviewing and practicing specific vocabulary words and phrases relevant to their language learning goals.

3. **Ending the Language Learning Session:** When the user is satisfied with their vocabulary review, they conclude the language learning session from the language learning module or settings.

4. **Session Summary:** Users can access a summary of the language learning session, which includes the start and end times and a list of vocabulary words and phrases reviewed.

5. **Reviewing Session History:** Users have the option to revisit their session history, allowing them to track their language learning progress over time.

#### **Design Considerations**

**Aspect: How start & end executes**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Creating another separate class to manage the logic.
  * Pros: It better adheres to OOP principle and easier to maintain.
  * Cons: It may potentially increase the complexity of codes.

* Alternative 2: Introducing a boolean attribute inside `FlashlingoParser` class.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: It doesn't conform to the principle of **Single Responsibility Principle**. 


**Aspect: Preventing Commands Within a Review Session**

* Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Restricting Users with a Subset of Commands

   * Pros:
   - Increased safety: A limited set of commands reduces the risk of unintended actions, making the review session safer for users.

   * Cons:
      - Limited flexibility: Users may feel constrained if they need to perform specific actions that are not allowed within the review session.
      - Potential user frustration: Restricting commands may lead to user frustration if they can't perform certain actions they expected to be available.

* Alternative 2: Giving Users Full Flexibility to Execute All Commands

   * Pros:
     - Complete control: Users have the freedom to use any command, providing them with full flexibility and control over their learning experience.
     - No perceived limitations: Users are less likely to encounter restrictions or frustrations, making the experience more intuitive.

  * Cons:
     - More error-prone: Allowing all commands may lead to unexpected bugs during a review session.

### Yes and No

#### **Feature Overview**

The "Yes" and "No" commands feature has been created with the intention of enabling users to provide feedback during the review session. It empowers users to share their opinions regarding whether they have successfully committed the words to memory or not. Following the receipt of this feedback, the application will adjust the proficiency level of the specific word in question. The greater the number of times a user memorizes a word, the higher its proficiency level will rise, and subsequently, the longer the user will have before revisiting that particular word during future review sessions.

*Usage*

Both commands can be executed with the following command words:

- For indicating successful memorization: `yes`
- For indicating unsuccessful memorization: `no`

### **Code Structure**

The YesCommand and NoCommand classes consist of important methods:

- `execute(Model model)`: This method is responsible for executing the command. It updates the model and retrieves the next review word. It returns a `CommandResult` with the success message and, if applicable, the response from the model.

#### **Implementation**

The implementation of the "Yes" and "No" commands invoke the `rememberWord` and `nextReviewWord` methods.

- **rememberWord:** denotes whether the user has successfully memorized the word or not.

The application recognizes a word as memorized if the user inputs either 'yes' or 'no.' 

It's important to note that the 'yes' and 'no' commands are only functional once the review session has commenced.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the yes/no mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:** The user initiates the review session, and a single word appears on the screen without its translation.

**Step 2:** The user recalls the translation from memory and compares it with the provided translation.

**Step 3:** The user responds with either 'yes' or 'no' to indicate whether the recalled translation matches the recorded one.

**Step 4:** If 'yes' is chosen, the `rememberWord` method within the `Model` class is invoked with the 'true' parameter; if 'no' is chosen, it is invoked with 'false'.

**Step 5:** Inside the `rememberWord` method, the proficiency level of the current word is updated, and the next review date for the word is determined based on the updated proficiency level.

**Step 6:** The `nextReviewWord` method is called to present the next word for review. If there are no more words to review, the session concludes.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the workflow when a user executes a `yes` command:

![StartSequnceModel](images/YesSequenceDiagram.png)

**User Control:**
- User can update the proficiency level of every individual word and also the revisited date, which allows the user to learn in a more targeted manner

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `yes` command:

![StartSequnceModel](images/YesCommandActivityDiagram.png)
#### **Usage Example**
To use the YesCommand, simply type yes during a review session. For example:

- `yes` 
- `no`

#### **Design Considerations**

**Aspect: How to make our programs more interactive**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Let the user judge whether he has remembered the word.
    * Pros: Get real-time feedback from users and adjust the proficiency of each word.
    * Cons: Users may trick the program to achieve higher accuracy.

* Alternative 2: Let the user enter the translation he recalls and the program compares it with the recorded translation.
    * Pros: Get real reactions from users.
    * Cons: It is difficult for the program to determine whether the meaning expressed by the two translations is consistent

### Light and Dark Mode

#### Implementation

The preference for light and dark themes is stored in the `UserPrefs` class. The `UserPrefs` is initialized by interacting
with `UserPrefsStorage` when the application is launched. Then `UI` component will obtain the preference from `Logic` 
component and set the initial theme. After a `SwitchCommand` is executed by the `LogicManager`, `Model` component will 
update the theme in  `UserPrefs`. Finally, `UI` component will update the theme accordingly.

Step 1: Theme initialization.  
Similar to GUI settings, the theme is regarded as a component of user preference stored in `UserPrefs` and in Json
file **preferences.json**.

The initial theme setting works as follows: After constructing the `ModelManager` and `LogicManager` with the 
loaded `UserPrefs`, `MainWindow` will obtain theme preference from `LogicManager` and set the initial theme. If no data 
can be read from the preference file, the **Default** theme will be used by `Logic` and `Model` components, and set by
`UI`.

Step 2: Theme switching.  
The following sequence diagram shows how the theme switching works. For the discussion purpose, parsing of the command
and `Storage#saveFlashlingo(ReadOnlyFlashlingo)` are omitted:

![SwitchSequenceModel](images/SwitchSequenceDiagram.png)

To be added: `Mainwindow#executeCommand`.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to update UI changes after command execution:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Uses `Logic` component to update `Model` and `Storage`. Add a boolean field **switchTheme**
in `CommandResult`, informing `UI` to update similarly to what we did in **help** and **exit** commands.
    * Pros: Follows the separation of concerns principle. Each component is responsible for its own work and addresses 
  separate concerns, achieving higher cohesion and lower coupling.
    * Cons: The abstraction and division for different components may be complicated and hard to understand. Additional
  field needed in `CommandResult` class.

* Alternative 2: Let `UI` component update the theme directly after receiving the command.
    * Pros: More direct implementation design.
    * Cons: Needs to include more information returned from the execution of command. A potential gap between current storage
  and UI theme setting would occur since `UI` wouldn't rely on `Logic` component to update the theme.

### Learning Statistics

#### **Feature Overview**

The stats command provides insights into a user's learning journey within Flashlingo. By visualizing progress and areas of improvement, this feature aims to motivate users and enhance their learning experience.

#### Implementation

The stats command accesses the stored number of words remembered from the last session, accesses them and retrun the result as a success rate to help inspire the user to continue learning.

The execute method accesses the numberOfWords from the model.

To be added: Making the success rate more relatable by remembering data(storing) from the last session.
### Usage
To know their learning rate, the user can just type in:
* `stats`
#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How should the learning statistics be presented to ensure clarity and comprehensibility?**
* Decision: We chose to represent data in numerical formats accompanied by textual descriptions. In future versions, we may integrate visual charts and graphs.
* Rationale: A straightforward representation ensures that users can quickly grasp their progress without misinterpretations.
